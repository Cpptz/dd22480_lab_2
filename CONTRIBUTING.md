## Contributing

## Development
1. Go to the *Projects*  tab
2. Select on task, convert it to issue, and move it to *In progress* card
3. Develop the functionnalities and associated unit tests
4. Push it to a branch named **iss_42** for the issue 42 for example
5. When you think, your task is completely done and pushed on the remote branch, move your task to *Need to be checked* card and make a PR on master branch. Your PR comment should include a message to automatically close the issue (when the PR will be merged in master) such as *Resolve #42*

## Code review
1. Select a PR, corresponding to a *Need to be checked* task
2. Review the code.
3. If you are the first to review this PR, put a comment on it. And if you are the second, and you think as the first reviewer that the PR  is legitimate then merge into master.
This means **at least two people should review a PR !!**
